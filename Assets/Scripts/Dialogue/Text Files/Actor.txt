Hey barista, one {item}, please! 
[End]

[Success]
Wow, this is amazing, I can see why you’re a barista! Great stuff! Truly a master at work~!
[End]

[Failure]
Bleurgh- What is this?
How could you serve something like this to someone as famous as me?
If I left a review on this place, you’d be out of business in minutes!
[End]

[Story]
Yep, it’s me. The one! The only!!
You know me from the hit shows The Workplace, Acquaintances, Tournament of seats, yep, it’s me in the flesh, or I guess in the spirit. And no, I don’t do autographs.
WHAT?!
You don’t know who I am?
Were you living under a rock for your whole life?! I guess it is a nice change of pace though.
Well, see ya around, barista~!
[End]

[Story]
Hmm, my fame?
Oh, it was absolutely a~mazing!
I got invites to all of the events in Hollyboo. 
You know, at some point in fame, people just start giving you free stuff: money, food, drinks, even property!
Like this one time, this chick gifted me their giant stuffed animal that was nearly twice my size!
Honestly I was shocked, but hey, who says no to free things, hm?
And opportunities, I was absolutely SWIMMING in them.
But the best part was the parties!
Every!
DAY!
Never a boring moment with those people. Man, those were the times.
[End]

[Story]
Why am I a ghost?
Well, heh- I really did have everything everyone could imagine.
But you know… what even comes after that? Even amidst all of the flashing lights, people, and drinks, I-I can’t shake off this sense of… loneliness?
Like what comes after all of this? I have fun, but once excitement leaves me and I find myself alone in the mansion, everything just feels so…empty.
Ugh, this depressing stuff does NOT suit me at all.
I’m a star after all! I can’t be seen moping around like this!
[End]

[Story]
You know, barista, it’s kind of exhausting to stay under the spotlight for your whole life.
Everyone’s always clamoring around you to get a chance at that next opportunity.
Hah, out of all my friends, who even knows me…for me?
I’ve acted in countless movies that explore this very topic but, funnily enough, I still haven’t found the answer myself.
There’s this nagging voice in the back of my head that tells me everyone just wants to use me in their career…
That everyone only loves the confident and cocky world-famous actor persona I’ve built, but I really wonder if it’s true. 
[End]

[Story]
I know I’ve kinda just been one-sidedly ranting to you this whole time, but…I have to admit, it really made me think about my life.
Haha, this is so un-star-like. Like c’mon man.
But still, it’s nice to actually have someone listen to you, for once.
Just me, and not the persona that I’ve created. Made me really appreciate the ones that don’t just latch onto my and my stardom…
Thanks, man. See you, barista~! Aaaaaand cut!
