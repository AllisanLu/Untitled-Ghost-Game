[End]

[Failure]
Failure: What is this! DISGUSTING!!! I want you FIRED! Who is your boss?!? …you’re self employed?
[End]

[Story1]
Well, I certainly don’t see what all the fuss is about. This looks like any old raggedy coffee shop to me.
[End]

[Story2]
I’m only here because the other cafes always mess up my order! Hmph. Don’t get a big head about it.
[End]

[Story3]
How I died?? Do you have no manners?!? Not that it’s any of your business, but I was…left behind, during a camping trip, and I…didn’t have a way out of the forest.
There, happy?
[End]

[Story4]
Why I’m still here? ….I guess I was just waiting for someone to look for me.
Not that it matters now, anyways. I’m a ghost, and anyone who might’ve come for me is dead now.
